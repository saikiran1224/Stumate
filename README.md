## üß† Motivation behind Developing this Application

As an engineering student I have personally experienced the tension every student have before night of the exam. Students üë®‚Äçüíª will be involved in gathering all the documents starting from PPTs to PDFs, etc. related to Course. Most of the times, all the notes are scattered it gets difficult to collect them. This app helps to solve the problem which helps them to keep all the notes at **one place** and ables every student to access it hassle-free.


## üßê Why Stumate?

We do have alternatives like Google Drive, WhatsApp, etc. but Stumate has some unique features that the other platforms which may or not provide. Stumate provide every services for free and will not charge anything from the student. Currently it is developed for GMR Institute of Technology, based on the requests and the demand we will be enhancing it.
